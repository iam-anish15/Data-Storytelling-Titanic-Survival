# Data Storytelling: Analysing Survival on the Titanic  

### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project explores the **Titanic dataset** to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival. Using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques and automated profiling with **ydata-profiling**, we generate insights about demographics, social class, and other key variables.  

---

### ðŸ“Š Key Insights from Profiling  
- **Dataset**: 891 passengers, 15 variables  
- **Gender & Survival**: Females had a much higher survival rate compared to males  
- **Class & Survival**: First-class passengers survived at significantly higher rates than third-class  
- **Age Distribution**: Children had better chances of survival than adults  
- **Engineered Features**: Family size, IsAlone, Cabin availability, and Title provided strong signals for survival
